## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Incidences
The COVID-19 cases reported by the Robert Koch Institute

```{r, echo=FALSE}
#plot(pressure)
params$plots$RKIPlot+theme_minimal(base_size=14)
```

Last useful 7-day RKI incidence (per 100 000): 
```{r, echo=FALSE} 
params$latest7day 
```
Last reported daily incidence: 
```{r, echo=FALSE} 
params$latestReport 
```


Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
